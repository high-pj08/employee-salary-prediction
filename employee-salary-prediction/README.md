🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based solution to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data. It leverages classification algorithms to build a predictive model using the Adult Income Dataset (UCI Repository).

📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict whether a person earns more than $50K annually using features such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, etc. This helps in analyzing income patterns and assists organizations in candidate profiling and decision-making.
